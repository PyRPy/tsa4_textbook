## Example 1.7 Moving Averages and Filtering
```{r}
w = rnorm(500, 0, 1)
v = filter(w, sides = 2, rep(1/3, 3))
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
tsplot(w, main = "white noise")
tsplot(v, ylim = c(-3, 3),main = "moving average")
```

## Example 1.8 Autoregressions
```{r}
w = rnorm(550, 0, 1)
x = filter(w, filter = c(1, -0.9), method = "recursive")[-(1:50)]
tsplot(x, main = "autoregression")
```

## Example 1.9 Random Walk with Drift
```{r}
set.seed(154)
w = rnorm(200)
x = cumsum(w)
wd = w + 0.2
xd = cumsum(wd)

tsplot(xd, ylim = c(-5, 55), main = "random walk", ylab = "")
abline(a = 0, b = 0.2, lty = 2)
lines(x, col = 4)
abline(h = 9, col = 4, lty = 2)
```
